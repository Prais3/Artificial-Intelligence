# Main

IDE: PyCharm

Python: Python 3.6.1

Operating System: Windows

Description: The program is divided into three different problems, all solvable using simple python code. Of course, the 
problem has many other loopholes which can be filled to make it efficient and work for other test cases, edge cases and problems.
The first problem is the N-Queen problem, more details given below. The second one is the Lights out problem, and the third one 
is the Linear Disk Movement problem. Detailed idea for the problems will be given soon to understand the code much better.

# Simple_Calc

IDE: Atom

Python: Python 3.6.7

Operating System: Linux

Description: This program uses two while loops to allow the user to calculate as much as the user wants.It only involves four
basic calculations and checks whether the user only inputs a choice involving these four operators only. This is one of my 
first python programs when I was really new to it.
